It uses functional components which is a common pattern in React.\\n4. There is no function in the code that is omitted or not fully implemented. All components are fully implemented.\\n5.

This is a good practice as it improves readability and ensures that the components are defined before they are used. Also, I have used implicit return for the functional components which makes the code cleaner and easier to read.')"
